# Investigate-Shakila-Movie-Database
In this project, I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answered interesting questions about the database. As part of my project submission, I ran SQL queries and built visualizations to showcase the output of my queries.

## Questions
- What is the number of rental orders per each family friendly movie category?
- What is the total number of rental orders for each store per month?
- Who are the top ten customers and how is their payment count?
- Who are the customers with highest payment difference across successive month?
